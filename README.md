<h1> MERN: Weathering With You Clone: Request Board App</h1>
<p>This web application was based from the a website that was made in the move "Weathering With You" by Makoto Shinkai. </p>
<p>In the movie the two characters created a website where they can get request for their services. There is an official website where production company made it themselves which can be found at https://sunshine-girl.us/ </p>
<p> I made a clone of it using the MERN stack compared to the original which uses Wordpress. I changed the styling with Materialize a CSS Framework.</p>
<p> The Technologies I used Mongoose, MongoDb Atlas, Express, React, Node, Materialize, JSX </p>
